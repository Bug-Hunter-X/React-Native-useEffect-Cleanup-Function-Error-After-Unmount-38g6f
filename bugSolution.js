The solution involves checking if the component is still mounted before performing any operations within the cleanup function.  We can use a ref to track whether the component is mounted or not.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const isMounted = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      if (isMounted.current) {
        setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      isMounted.current = false;
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

By setting `isMounted.current` to `false` in the cleanup function and checking it before updating state, we prevent the error and ensure proper cleanup.
