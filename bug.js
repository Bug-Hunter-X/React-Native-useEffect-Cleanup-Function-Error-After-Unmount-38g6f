This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  This can happen if the cleanup function tries to access a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  For instance, consider the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval);
      // Throws an error if component is unmounted before this line
      console.log('Count:', count); // Error: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```
